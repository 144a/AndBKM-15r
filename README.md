# AndBKM-15r
A Simple Android App to emulate the Sony BKM-15r controller for A series BVMs

AndBKM-15r is very primitive in this stage, and as such there are a number of graphical and logic issues that it still currently has. The goal is not to make something extremely feature heavy, but rather to allow for the utility of the BKM-15r without having to own one.

Instructions to get started:
1) Go out and buy a usb type c to ethernet adapter. 
2) Download the zip file and unzip the APK.
3) Install the APK on the desired android device.
4) Plug in the usb type c to ethernet adapter and set the static IP to 192.168.0.100 (Very important).
5) Turn on airplane mode (Also important).
6) Wait for about 5 seconds after connecting to monitor.
7) Open app and enjoy.

Feel free to reach out if there are any suggestions or bugs that come up.
